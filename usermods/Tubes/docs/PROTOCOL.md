# Tubes Mesh Protocol

This document defines the Tubes mesh protocol that is already deployed in the
field. The protocol is the compatibility contract. WLED Tubes is the current
reference implementation, but future implementations should be able to interoperate
by following this document rather than by copying WLED internals.

The current deployed protocol is **Tubes Mesh Protocol v2**.

## Compatibility Contract

Tubes exist in a mixed fleet. Some devices can be updated immediately, some can be
updated with effort, and some may never be updated but can still rejoin a flock at
future events.

Protocol compatibility therefore means:

- Existing v2 packets must keep their byte layout and semantic meaning.
- Existing command IDs, pattern IDs, palette IDs, sync modes, effect modes, pen
  modes, action keys, and role values must not be repurposed.
- Newer devices may add a future protocol, but their Control owner must project
  representable state into v2 for legacy followers.
- In a mixed flock, newer devices use their native declarations while legacy devices
  render the Control owner's v2 `State` projection.
- Future-only features should be additive: side-channel beacons, extension packets,
  capability-gated commands, or dual-broadcast behavior.

## Protocol Layers

The Tubes protocol is carried over ESP-NOW broadcasts today, but the logical
protocol is a mesh envelope plus a command payload.

Transport requirements:

| Attribute | v2 value |
|---|---|
| Delivery model | Local broadcast |
| Addressing model | Mesh node IDs inside the payload |
| Reliability | Best effort |
| Ordering | Not guaranteed |
| Encryption | None at the Tubes protocol layer |
| Current carrier | ESP-NOW broadcast to `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` |
| Current v2 packet length | 84 bytes |

## Encoding Rules

All v2 numeric values are little-endian. The current protocol came from raw ESP32
C++ struct serialization, so v2 includes padding and reserved bytes. Those bytes are
part of the on-wire format.

Rules for non-WLED implementations:

- Send exactly 84 bytes for a v2 Tubes mesh packet.
- Read and write little-endian integers.
- Set known reserved bytes to zero when generating packets.
- Ignore reserved bytes when receiving packets.
- Keep all payload fields at their documented offsets.
- Leave unused bytes in the 64-byte command payload as zero. The sole proposed
  exception is the v3 compatibility bridge's marker in payload bytes `48..63`,
  defined under [Legacy detection and compatibility trailer](#legacy-detection-and-compatibility-trailer);
  v2-only receivers still ignore those bytes.

## Mesh Envelope

Every v2 Tubes mesh packet uses this 84-byte envelope:

| Byte offset | Size | Name | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | 2 | `senderId` | `u16le` | Device ID of the node that transmitted this packet. |
| 2 | 2 | `senderUplinkId` | `u16le` | Device ID the sender follows, or `0` if none. |
| 4 | 1 | `protocolVersion` | `u8` | Must be `2` for this protocol. |
| 5 | 1 | `headerReserved` | `u8` | Reserved. Ignore on receive. Send as `0`. |
| 6 | 2 | `reservedA` | `u16` | Reserved alignment bytes. Ignore on receive. Send as `0`. |
| 8 | 4 | `recipients` | `u32le` | Routing class. See Recipient Classes. |
| 12 | 4 | `timebase` | `u32le` | Sender's clock reference in milliseconds. |
| 16 | 1 | `command` | `u8` | Command ID. |
| 17 | 64 | `payload` | bytes | Command-specific payload. |
| 81 | 3 | `trailerReserved` | bytes | Reserved alignment bytes. Ignore on receive. Send as `0`. |

## Node Identity

Each device chooses a `senderId`. Higher IDs dominate lower IDs in the current
leader-election behavior.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `senderId` | The sender's current Device ID. |
| `senderUplinkId` | The ID this sender currently follows. `0` means the sender has no uplink. |
| `protocolVersion` | The sender's mesh protocol version. Current deployed packets use `2`. |

Current ID conventions:

| Device class | ID range or value |
|---|---|
| Normal ESP32 v2 tubes | Random `256..3999` |
| Some S2/S3/C3 builds with `LOLIN_WIFI_FIX` | Random `10..254` |
| Master-role nodes | High ID, commonly `3850 + role` |
| Compile-time master variants | Often forced to `0xFFF` |

If a node receives a packet with its own `senderId`, it treats that as an ID
collision and chooses a new ID.

### Generation-qualified Device IDs

Beginning with the channel-protocol migration, the 16-bit `senderId` and
`senderUplinkId` fields have a formal internal structure:

| Bits | Name | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| `15..12` | Protocol generation | Protocol namespace; `0` is legacy and `1` is the channel protocol. |
| `11..0` | Protocol-local value | Randomly generated or configured value within that protocol generation. |

The complete word is the Device ID: `deviceId = (generation << 12) | protocolLocalValue`.
Deployed v2 poles already
emit generation `0` because their IDs occupy only the low 12 bits. A generation-1
pole with protocol-local value `ADC` uses Device ID `1ADC` in native packets and V2-layout compatibility
packets. Legacy receivers preserve all 16 bits and therefore interpret `1ADC` as an
ordinary higher ID, which makes the generation transition backward compatible with
their existing election algorithm.

All routing, payload references, reports, diagnostics, collision checks, and operator
references use the full Device ID. `0ADC` and `1ADC` are distinct and do not collide.
The protocol-local value is used separately only while generating or normalizing an ID and in
bounded calculations such as startup staggering and debug-pixel placement.

The `protocolVersion` byte still selects the packet layout and decoder; it is separate
from the generation nibble. See
[`V3_CHANNEL_MIGRATION.md`](V3_CHANNEL_MIGRATION.md#device-identity-and-protocol-generation)
for the generation-1 routing and migration rules.

## Recipient Classes

`recipients` is a 4-byte little-endian value.

| Value | Name | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `All` | Downstream visual/state message. Followers accept only from their uplink. |
| 1 | `Root` | Upstream request. Nodes accept only from direct downlinks. |
| 2 | `Info` | Broadcast informational message. All nodes may accept. |

Recipient acceptance:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Packet["Receive v2 packet"] --> Ping["Update mesh topology from senderId/uplinkId"]
  Ping --> R{"recipients"}
  R -->|"All"| A{"senderId == my uplink?"}
  R -->|"Root"| B{"senderUplinkId == my senderId?"}
  R -->|"Info"| C["Accept"]
  A -->|"yes"| C
  A -->|"no"| Drop["Ignore payload"]
  B -->|"yes"| C
  B -->|"no"| Drop
```

## Mesh Behavior

The mesh is intentionally simple:

- Nodes follow the highest-ID node they can hear.
- A follower treats its chosen higher-ID node as its uplink.
- Followers accept `All` messages only from their uplink.
- Upstream commands from followers use `Root`.
- Nodes that appear to be on a path between lower-ID devices and a leader may
  rebroadcast messages for a short period.

### Following

A node switches uplink when it hears a sender whose ID is greater than both:

- the node's own ID, and
- the node's current uplink ID.

If a follower hears from its current uplink, it refreshes a 20-second uplink
timeout. If that timeout expires, the node unfollows and becomes independent until
it hears a higher-ID node again.

### Rebroadcast

Rebroadcast is used to extend range through the flock.

A node enters rebroadcast mode for about 30 seconds when it hears evidence that a
lower-ID node is below it in the mesh. While in that mode, it may retransmit accepted
non-`Info` packets after replacing the packet header with its own node ID and uplink
ID.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant L as Leader high ID
  participant R as Relay follower
  participant F as Far follower

  L->>R: All / State
  R->>F: rebroadcast All / State
  F->>R: Root / Action or BPM request
  R->>L: rebroadcast Root / Action or BPM request
  L->>R: All / updated State
  R->>F: rebroadcast All / updated State
```

## Timebase

`timebase` is a 32-bit millisecond clock reference. Its purpose is to let receivers
align LED animation timing across devices.

Sender behavior:

```text
timebase = local_effect_timebase + local_millis
```

Receiver behavior:

```text
candidate_timebase = packet.timebase - local_millis + transport_delay_allowance
if abs(candidate_timebase - local_effect_timebase) > jitter_threshold:
    local_effect_timebase = candidate_timebase
```

The deployed implementation uses:

| Name | Value |
|---|---:|
| `transport_delay_allowance` | 3 ms |
| `jitter_threshold` | 10 ms |

## Command Registry

| Command ID | Name | Payload | Payload bytes used | Purpose |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| `0x10` | `Options` | `OptionsPayload` | 14 | Brightness and debug options. |
| `0x20` | `State` | `StatePayload` | 48 | Core visual state. |
| `0x30` | `Action` | `ActionPayload` | 2 | Small control actions. |
| `0x40` | `Info` | `InfoPayload` | 41 | Human-readable status/info. |
| `0x50` | `Beats` | `BeatsPayload` | 2 | BPM request. |
| `0xE0` | `Upgrade` | `UpgradePayload` | variable | Update offer. Not reliable in current v2 implementation. |
| `0xE1` | `FleetUpgrade` | `FleetUpdateOffer` | 44 | Gen1-only LAN pull offer; old firmware ignores it and the existing `0xE0` migration path remains unchanged. |
| `0xF0` | `Reset` | none | 0 | Reserved/defined, not currently handled. |

Unknown command IDs must be ignored. They should not change visible output.

## State Command

`State` is the core visual protocol. It carries the sender's current visual state
and a scheduled next visual state.

The paired current/next state is a core design property of Tubes, not an
implementation accident. Devices may hear the mesh intermittently; by continuously
sharing both what is active now and what is scheduled next, each device can keep
running through short reception gaps without visible interruptions or local drift.
In normal operation, receivers often know the flock's visual plan for the next
30 seconds or more.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S["State payload: 48 bytes"] --> C["Current VisualState: 24 bytes"]
  S --> N["Next VisualState: 24 bytes"]
  C --> Clock["Clock/BPM"]
  C --> Pattern["Pattern + sync"]
  C --> Palette["Palette"]
  C --> Effect["Effect overlay"]
```

Payload layout:

| Payload offset | Size | Name | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | 24 | `current` | `VisualState` | State that should be active now. |
| 24 | 24 | `next` | `VisualState` | Scheduled upcoming state. |
| 48 | 16 | unused | bytes | Leave as zero. |

| 2 | 2 | `reservedA` | bytes | Alignment/reserved. Ignore on receive. |
| 4 | 4 | `beatFrame` | `u32le` | Beat counter in 24.8 fixed point. |
| 8 | 2 | `patternPhrase` | `u16le` | Phrase when this pattern became/becomes active. |
| 10 | 1 | `patternId` | `u8` | Pattern registry ID. |
| 11 | 1 | `syncMode` | `u8` | Sync-mode registry ID. |
| 12 | 2 | `palettePhrase` | `u16le` | Phrase when this palette became/becomes active. |

| 21 | 1 | `effectChance` | `u8` | Probability threshold. |
| 22 | 2 | `reservedC` | bytes | Tail padding/reserved. Ignore on receive. |

### Clock Fields

`bpm` is unsigned 8.8 fixed point:

| Example | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0x7800` | 120.00 BPM |
| `0x7D00` | 125.00 BPM |
| `0x787F` | About 120.50 BPM |

`beatFrame` is unsigned 24.8 fixed point:

| Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `beatFrame >> 8` | Whole beat count |
| `beatFrame & 0xff` | Fraction within beat |
| `beatFrame >> 12` | 16-beat phrase number |
| `(beatFrame >> 8) % 16` | Beat index inside the current phrase |

### Sync Mode Registry

| Value | Name | Visual meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `All` | Use the shared beat frame directly. |
| 1 | `SinDrift` | Add a small sinusoidal drift. |
| 2 | `Pulse` | Pulse brightness over time. |
| 3 | `Swing` | Apply swing/easing to the beat. |
| 4 | `SwingDrift` | Swing plus sinusoidal drift. |

### Pattern Registry

`patternId` selects a protocol pattern, not merely a WLED effect number. The ID binds together a visual family, an implementation renderer, and the intent parameters that Tubes uses when choosing patterns.

The `Duration` and `Energy` values are part of the protocol vocabulary because they are how repeated-looking entries become distinct variants. Some IDs intentionally share the same renderer and parameters; those rows are weighting variants that bias random pattern selection while still preserving stable on-wire IDs.

| Duration | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `ExtraShortDuration` | 0 | very fast / momentary |
| `ShortDuration` | 10 | short-lived |
| `MediumDuration` | 20 | normal cadence |
| `LongDuration` | 30 | lingering |
| `ExtraLongDuration` | 40 | very slow / persistent |

| Energy | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `Boring` | 0 | calm / low motion |
| `Chill` | 10 | default medium-low energy |
| `MediumEnergy` | 20 | medium activity |
| `HighEnergy` | 230 | intense / event-like |

| ID | Family | Renderer | Duration | Energy | Variant |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|

Implementations do not have to use WLED effect IDs internally, but they must preserve the semantics of each `patternId` when participating in the legacy mesh. If a renderer is unavailable, the closest local renderer should be chosen by family, duration, energy, and variant intent.

### Palette Registry

`paletteId` selects a palette by stable protocol ID. Palette names are advisory; the ID and descriptor are the wire contract.

Descriptor syntax for gradient palettes is `@position #RRGGBB`, where `position` is a stop from `0` to `255`. IDs `0` through `5` are dynamic or local palettes, IDs `6` through `12` are fixed built-in palettes, and IDs `13` through `128` are Tubes gradient palettes with explicit stop descriptors.

| ID | Name | Descriptor |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | Default | Effect default or locally selected palette; no fixed gradient descriptor |
| 1 | * Random Cycle | Runtime-generated random palette; descriptor is intentionally unstable |
| 2 | * Color 1 | Solid Color 1 |
| 3 | * Colors 1&2 | Color 1 to Color 2 gradient |
| 4 | * Color Gradient | Color 3 to Color 2 to Color 1 gradient |
| 5 | * Colors Only | Discrete local color blocks from configured colors |

A future protocol may transmit a literal gradient descriptor as an overlay command, but the legacy `paletteId` should continue to resolve to these descriptors so older Tubes see the same color intent.

### Effect Registry

`effectMode`:

| Value | Name | Visual meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `None` | No overlay effect. |

| 4 | `White` | Force white. |
| 5 | `Black` | Force black. |
| 6 | `Brighten` | Brighten target pixels. |
| 7 | `Darken` | Darken target pixels. |
| 8 | `Flicker` | Flicker/dither effect. |

`beatPulse`:

| Value | Name | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `Continuous` | Effect may run continuously. |
| 1 | `Eighth` | Trigger on eighth-beat pulse. |
| 2 | `Quarter` | Trigger on quarter-beat pulse. |
| 4 | `Half` | Trigger on half-beat pulse. |

| 32 | `Measure` | Trigger every measure. |
| 64 | `TwoMeasures` | Trigger every two measures. |
| 128 | `Phrase` | Trigger every phrase. |

`effectChance` is a probability threshold from `0..255`. The deployed behavior
triggers when a random byte is less than or equal to `effectChance`.

## Options Command

`Options` controls simple fleet-wide device options.

Payload layout:

| Payload offset | Size | Name | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `debugging` | `u8 bool` | Nonzero enables debug display behavior. |
| 1 | 1 | `brightness` | `u8` | Target brightness. |
| 2 | 12 | `reserved` | bytes | Reserved. Send zero; ignore on receive. |
| 14 | 50 | unused | bytes | Leave as zero. |

## Action Command

`Action` carries a compact operator command.

Payload layout:

| Payload offset | Size | Name | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `key` | ASCII byte | Action key. |
| 1 | 1 | `arg` | `u8` | Action argument. |
| 2 | 62 | unused | bytes | Leave as zero. |

Action registry:

| Key | Arg | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `A` | ignored | Turn on access point / visible admin mode. |
| `O` | 0/1 | Disable/enable sound overlay. |
| `X` | ignored | Reboot if selected. |
| `R` | role | Set role if selected. |
| `@` | 0/1 | Set power-save mode. |
| `W` | ignored | Clear Wi-Fi client credentials. |
| `G` | ignored | Add glitter locally. |
| `F` | hue | Flash all LEDs using the hue. |
| `M` | ignored | Cancel manual WLED override mode. |
| `*` | ignored | Enter selection window. |
| `(` | ignored | Enter selection window. |
| `)` | ignored | Exit selection/update-ready mode. |
| `V` | version | Select node for update if local version is older. |
| `U` | ignored | Start update if selected. |

Unrecognized action keys must be ignored.

## Info Command

Payload layout:

| Payload offset | Size | Name | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `status` | `u8` | Status code. |
| 1 | 40 | `message` | bytes | Human-readable text, normally null-terminated. |
| 41 | 23 | unused | bytes | Leave as zero. |

`Info` is informational and should not change visual state.

## Beats Command

`Beats` is a request to change BPM.

Payload layout:

| Payload offset | Size | Name | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | 2 | `bpm` | `u16le` | BPM in 8.8 fixed point. |
| 2 | 62 | unused | bytes | Leave as zero. |

Typical routing:

- Followers send `Beats` as `Root`.
- A root or capable relay updates the clock and then emits a normal `State`.
- Master-role devices may ignore `Beats` if they use their own beat source.

## Upgrade Command

`Upgrade` is reserved for update offers. It is defined in the deployed command
registry but is not a reliable interoperability surface in current v2.

Future update protocols should treat update control as an extension channel and keep
v2 `State`/`Action` behavior independent of it.

## Reset Command

`Reset` is reserved. No v2 payload or behavior is currently defined.

## Role Registry

Roles are local device behavior values, currently used by some actions and local
configuration.

| Value | Name | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `UnknownRole` | Uninitialized or unknown. |
| 10 | `DefaultRole` | Power-saving default role. |
| 50 | `CampRole` | Non-power-saving camp role. |
| 100 | `InstallationRole` | Installed/powered role. |
| 120 | `SmallArtRole` | Smaller display/scaled art role. |
| 190 | `LegacyRole` | Legacy half-pixel role. |
| 200 | `MasterRole` | Master/controller role. |

## Normal Cadence

The protocol is event-plus-heartbeat based.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Loop["Controller loop"] --> Beat["Advance local beat"]
  Beat --> Changes{"Phrase boundary?"}
  Changes -->|"yes"| StateNow["Update current/next visual state"]
  Changes -->|"no"| Timer{"Heartbeat due?"}
  StateNow --> Send["Broadcast State"]
  Timer -->|"root: every period"| Send
  Timer -->|"follower: sampled lower cadence"| Send
  Timer -->|"not due"| Render["Render locally"]
  Send --> Render
```

Current v2 cadence conventions:

| Event | Cadence |
|---|---|
| State heartbeat | Every 2000 ms from non-followers |
| Follower state heartbeat | About one out of four 2000 ms periods |
| Uplink loss timeout | 20000 ms |
| Rebroadcast window | 30000 ms |
| Startup broadcast delay | `3000 - senderId / 2` ms |
| Phrase length | 16 beats |

## WiZ Remote Side Protocol

The same ESP-NOW receive path also accepts WiZ remote packets. These are not Tubes
mesh packets, do not use the 84-byte Tubes envelope, and are not rebroadcast as
mesh packets.

WiZ packet fields recognized by the current implementation:

| Offset | Size | Name | Expected value / meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `program` | `0x91` for ON, `0x81` for others. |
| 1 | 4 | `seq` | Little-endian sequence number. Duplicates ignored. |
| 5 | 1 | `byte5` | Must be `32`. |
| 6 | 1 | `button` | WiZ button ID. |
| 7 | 1 | `byte8` | Must be `1`. |
| 8 | 1 | `byte9` | Must be `100`. |
| 9 | 4 | `tail` | Unknown/checksum bytes. |

Recognized buttons:

| Button | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Turn on AP/debug and acknowledge. |
| 2 | Turn off AP/Wi-Fi/debug and acknowledge. |
| 3 | Master only: chill/120 BPM and force next. |
| 8 | Brightness down. |
| 9 | Brightness up. |
| 16 | Master only: choose a non-`All` sync pattern. |
| 17 | Master only: choose a non-empty effect. |
| 18 | Master only: 125 BPM and fire pattern. |
| 19 | Master only: force pattern 38. |

## Version 3 Implementation Candidate

This claim-based candidate and its fleet-wide compatibility fallback are retained as
design history. They were superseded by `V3_CHANNEL_MIGRATION.md`; the implemented
generation-1 protocol never yields visual authority to generation-0 `State` packets.

> **Superseded design:** The claim-based candidate below is retained as historical
> context. The active implementation and migration contract is
> [`V3_CHANNEL_MIGRATION.md`](V3_CHANNEL_MIGRATION.md), which keeps one Control tree,
> carries Beat, Pattern, and Palette as requests and declarations, and forward-adapts
> V2 state independently at every V3 receiver.

This section defines the v3 implementation on the `codex/tubes-v3-protocol`
branch. It is an implementation candidate, not yet a deployed fleet contract;
mixed-fleet capture and hardware tests remain rollout gates.

Version 3 is a parallel, topic-oriented protocol carried by the same ESP-NOW
transport. It is not a second radio network and it does not change the deployed v2
contract. A v3-capable receiver understands both 84-byte packet families; a v2-only
receiver continues to accept only packets whose outer version is `2`.

V3 exists to separate responsibilities that v2 combines inside one `State` packet.
Pattern, palette, beat, effect, debug, and position may each have a different
authority. The transport root routes and arbitrates requests, but it does not
automatically become the authority for every topic.

The central compatibility policy is conservative:

- An all-v3 connected component sends v3 application traffic and no routine v2
  traffic.
- Hearing evidence of any genuine v2-only device causes v3 devices in that connected
  component to enter v2 compatibility mode.
- Compatibility mode stops v3 application topics and makes every upgraded device
  render and broadcast the tested v2 visual contract.
- Compatibility mode expires only after genuine legacy evidence has been absent for
  a lease and upgraded devices reach a coordinated phrase boundary.
- A disconnected component can know only about devices whose evidence reaches it.
  "Any legacy pole" therefore means any legacy pole in the current radio-connected
  component, not a device in an unreachable partition.

### Design invariants

The following are requirements, not implementation suggestions:

1. V2 packet layouts, command IDs, registries, timing meanings, and visible behavior
   remain unchanged.
2. V3 authorities are independent. One device may lead beat while another leads
   pattern, palette, debug, or the position frame.
3. Unknown v3 topics, topic versions, fields, enum values, and flags are ignored.
4. Every visual v3 value that cannot be represented exactly in v2 carries an explicit
   v2 fallback.
5. Scheduled visual topics retain look-ahead. A receiver should normally know the
   current and next pattern, palette, and scheduled effect.
6. Relays may change the physical transport sender, but never the logical topic
   authority, authority session, sequence, or topic body.
7. Every untrusted ESP-NOW packet is length-checked and range-checked before it may
   alter routing, authority, clocks, rendering, or fixed-size caches.
8. All protocol state is bounded. Topic caches, peer tables, duplicate filters, and
   definition caches have compile-time capacities and deterministic eviction rules.

### V3 outer packet

The first v3 implementation keeps the 84-byte physical packet size and the same
outer offsets as v2. This avoids a second receive-buffer shape and remains well below
the 250-byte ESP-NOW v1 interoperability ceiling.

| Byte offset | Size | V3 meaning |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 2 | `transportSenderId`, the node physically transmitting this hop. |
| 2 | 2 | `transportUplinkId`, the sender's current mesh uplink. |
| 4 | 1 | Outer protocol version, exactly `3`. |
| 5 | 3 | Reserved; send zero and ignore on receive. |
| 8 | 4 | Recipient class using the existing `All`, `Root`, and `Info` values. |
| 12 | 4 | Mesh timebase in milliseconds. |
| 16 | 1 | Topic ID. |
| 17 | 64 | Common topic envelope followed by at most 48 body bytes. |
| 81 | 3 | Reserved; send zero and ignore on receive. |

V3-capable firmware must accept outer versions `2` and `3` in its receive filter and
dispatch them to separate decoders. A v3 packet is never cast to a v2 command payload,
and a v2 packet is never interpreted as a v3 topic.

### Topic registry

Topics are stable numeric values. Retired values remain reserved permanently.

| Value | Topic | Authority controls | Expected cadence | V2 fallback |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| `0x00` | `Presence` | Capabilities and compatibility state; no visual authority. | One per 10 seconds per node, staggered. | Compatibility trailer only. |
| `0x01` | `Beat` | BPM and beat phase. | On change and normally once per beat from one authority. | `State` clock fields plus phrase-boundary `Beats`. |
| `0x02` | `Pattern` | Pattern, sync mode, and pattern parameters. | On change plus low-rate authority heartbeat. | `patternId`, `syncMode`, and phrase fields in `State`. |
| `0x03` | `Palette` | Literal color palette and activation schedule. | Definition burst on change plus low-rate heartbeat. | `legacyPaletteId` and phrase fields in `State`. |
| `0x04` | `Effect` | Overlay/effect parameters and schedule. | Event-driven plus low-rate authority heartbeat. | Existing v2 effect fields or `Action`. |
| `0x05` | `Position` | Coordinate frame authority and direct-neighbor position beliefs. | Frame changes on demand; position advertisements about once per second per enabled node. | None; suspend in compatibility mode. |
| `0x06` | `Debug` | Fleet debug overlay and diagnostic presentation. | On change plus low-rate authority heartbeat. | `Options.debugging`. |
| `0x07` | `Control` | Existing non-visual v2 options, actions, and info while all-v3. | Event-driven. | Original v2 command. |
| `0x08..0x7f` | reserved core | Future standard topics. | Varies. | Must be defined per topic. |
| `0x80..0xef` | experimental/vendor | Local experiments. | Varies. | Must not affect v2 behavior without an explicit bridge. |
| `0xf0..0xff` | reserved control | Future protocol control or escape range. | Varies. | None. |

### Common topic envelope

Every v3 topic uses a fixed 16-byte common envelope. The topic body begins at payload
offset 16 and is limited to 48 bytes.

| Payload offset | Size | Field | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `topicVersion` | Version of this topic's body and semantics. |
| 1 | 1 | `messageKind` | `Heartbeat=0`, `Claim=1`, `State=2`, `Release=3`, `Definition=4`, `Schedule=5`, or `Advertisement=6`. |
| 2 | 1 | `flags` | Topic-defined optional flags. Unknown optional flags are ignored. |
| 3 | 1 | `bodyLength` | Number of valid body bytes, `0..48`. |
| 4 | 2 | `authorityId` | Logical authority for this topic; unaffected by relaying. |
| 6 | 1 | `priority` | Authority class chosen by the topic policy. |
| 7 | 1 | `quality` | Source quality where meaningful, otherwise zero. |
| 8 | 4 | `authoritySession` | Random boot/claim nonce preventing an old authority session from reviving. |
| 12 | 2 | `sequence` | Monotonic sequence within the authority session. |
| 14 | 2 | `leaseDeciseconds` | Requested authority lease in 100 ms units, clamped by the receiver. |

The common envelope is positional and immutable. V3 topic version 1 uses fixed,
packed bodies whose exact lengths are validated before decoding. A changed body
shape requires a new topic version; unknown topic versions are ignored.

### Routing and authority

Transport routing and topic authority are separate:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  C["Controller or sensor"] --> S["Any v3 device"]
  S -->|"Root: claim/state request"| R["Current transport root"]
  R -->|"All: canonical declaration"| F["V3 flock"]
  P["Position observation"] -->|"Info: one hop only"| N["Direct radio neighbors"]
```

- `Presence` and direct position advertisements use `Info` and are never relayed
  verbatim.
- Beat, pattern, palette, effect, and debug requests from followers travel `Root`.
- The transport root validates a request, serializes competing claims, and emits the
  canonical `All` declaration. Relays preserve the topic envelope and body.
- A root is an arbiter and distributor. It does not replace `authorityId` with its
  own ID unless it is itself the topic authority.
- Only an explicit `Claim` may replace a live authority. Ordinary `State`,
  `Definition`, `Schedule`, and `Heartbeat` packets from another source cannot claim
  ownership accidentally.
- A valid `Release` ends the matching authority session. Silence also releases the
  authority after its lease; followers retain the last valid state rather than
  resetting visually.
- The root accepts a new operator claim in receive order. Within a stable component,
  the latest accepted explicit claim therefore wins. After partitions merge, the
  surviving transport root republishes its canonical topic authorities; equal-priority
  unresolved conflicts use the higher authority ID as a deterministic tie-breaker.
- Receivers reject stale sessions, duplicate or backward sequences, excessive leases,
  impossible effective times, and topic values outside their documented ranges.

Topic leases are intentionally independent. Loss of a beat authority does not
release the palette authority, and a debug claim does not alter pattern leadership.

### Activation boundaries

Persistent visual operations are plans, not immediate mutations. Pattern, sync,
effect, palette, and sound-program requests set their `next` entry to the next whole
phrase, derived from the shared BPM clock. Authorities may schedule later phrases,
but must not publish a newly requested visual operation with phrase zero or the
already-partially-rendered current phrase.

The `current` entry is different: it describes state whose boundary has already
passed. A late receiver applies that snapshot immediately to catch up, then activates
`next` only when its effective phrase arrives. Beat clock correction and genuine
audio transients also apply on receipt because they synchronize or describe the beat
that is happening now; persistent Beat-channel sound programs remain phrase-bound.

The operator `n` command moves the earliest pending visual operation to the next
phrase and shifts the other pending phrases by the same amount, preserving their
relative timing. An unscheduled `UINT16_MAX` entry remains unscheduled.

### Presence and capabilities

`Presence` uses `Info` routing and a fixed 12-byte state body:

| Body offset | Size | Field |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 1 | Minimum supported outer version. |
| 1 | 1 | Maximum supported outer version. |
| 2 | 1 | Current compatibility mode. |
| 3 | 1 | Maximum accepted topic body length. |
| 4 | 2 | Supported topic bit mask. |
| 6 | 1 | Supported palette-format bit mask. |
| 7 | 1 | Palette-definition cache entries. |
| 8 | 4 | Sender boot session. |

Presence is advisory. A receiver still validates every packet and never assumes that
a capability beacon guarantees successful delivery. Devices do not wait for a known
population or unanimous negotiation before operating; they act on the bounded local
evidence they have heard.

### Beat authority

The Beat topic makes beat authority independent of transport root and visual master
roles. Its initial state body contains:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `bpm` | Unsigned 8.8 fixed-point BPM. |
| `beatFrame` | Complete unsigned 24.8 beat position. |
| `measuredAtTimebase` | Mesh time at which `beatFrame` was valid. |
| `sourceType` | Tap, microphone, USB/application, fixed clock, or future source. |
| `sourceLatencyMs` | Estimated source-processing delay, clamped to a topic maximum. |
| `quality` | Common-envelope quality score used for diagnostics and optional source policy. |

The source applies a new beat locally and issues a v3 request immediately. Followers
extrapolate from `measuredAtTimebase`; the first implementation may snap to large
errors and leave small errors alone until slewing has been evaluated.

The root accepts ticks only from the active authority/session. A roughly four-second
default lease is renewed by valid Beat states. On expiry, every device free-runs from
the last valid BPM and frame.

When entering compatibility mode, the bridge writes the active BPM and beat frame
into v2 `State`. A BPM change also schedules one legacy `Beats` declaration at the
source's next phrase boundary. Upgraded receivers relay but do not reapply their own
echoed legacy declaration while that bridge transition is pending.

### Pattern authority

Pattern owns pattern selection and sync mode but does not own palette, beat, effect,
or debug state. Its body supports current and next phrase-keyed entries containing:

- pattern definition or stable pattern ID;
- sync mode;
- pattern-specific bounded parameters;
- effective phrase;
- explicit `legacyPatternId` and `legacySyncMode`.

The first implementation should accept existing v2 pattern IDs and parameters before
adding generated pattern definitions. Pattern changes activate only at their declared
phrase. Missing, invalid, or unsupported future definitions leave the current pattern
running.

### Palette authority and literal colors

Palette is the color-master protocol. A palette authority can transmit colors that
are not compiled into the Tubes palette registry. Literal palettes are runtime state,
not persistent WLED custom-palette files, so frequent changes do not write flash.

The canonical gen1 representation is the same 16-entry RGB palette WLED renders.
Positions are implicit and evenly indexed, so all 48 RGB bytes fill one Palette
definition packet without approximation. A separate schedule packet references the
current and next definition sequence numbers and carries two entries of
`palettePhrase:u16, legacyPaletteId:u8`.

An authority sends current definition, next definition, then schedule. Receivers
cache both definitions and apply the schedule only when both references resolve, so
packet loss cannot expose a partial palette. The next definition becomes visible only
at its phrase boundary. Periodic publication renews the authority lease and repairs a
late join or a dropped definition.

All three packets retain the normal channel request/declaration message kind. Their
body lengths distinguish definitions from schedules, so Palette authority election,
upward forwarding, and downward relaying use exactly the same path as every other
application channel.

After the full schedule, the authority also sends the earlier ID-only Palette state.
Receivers that predate literal gradients reject the new body lengths and apply this
fallback declaration. Current receivers remember that the same authority and boot
session supplied a complete schedule, so they relay the ID-only declaration for older
descendants without replacing their runtime gradient. A changed authority or boot
session clears that memory and makes the ID-only state authoritative again.

For a predefined palette, the 16 RGB entries are copied directly from WLED's runtime
palette and `legacyPaletteId` is that exact built-in ID. For a generated gradient, the
Palette owner expands it once with WLED's palette rules, sends the resulting 16 RGB
entries, and computes the closest fixed palette ID by squared RGB error. The Control
root copies the fallback IDs into its ordinary generation-0 `State`, so gen0 poles
follow the same schedule with the closest colors they can represent. The fallback ID
does not replace literal colors on receivers that accepted the complete gradient
schedule.

Palette authority uses the normal per-channel `(channelId, controlId)` ordering. The
local `g` command sets the Palette channel's local value to `0xFFF`, making that pole
the Palette Master; a tie is resolved by the higher Control ID as usual.

### Effect authority

Effect owns generated particles, overlays, transforms, and their activation times.
It does not alter the base pattern or palette. Scheduled effects carry an effective
beat or phrase; immediate transient effects carry a bounded lifetime and sequence so
duplicates can be discarded.

Every persistent effect state supplies existing v2 effect, pen, pulse, and chance
fallbacks. A future effect with no safe v2 representation must fall back to `None`,
not to a reused effect ID with different meaning.

### Debug authority

Debug is a separate operator-controlled topic. Its first version carries:

- enabled/disabled state;
- a bounded overlay mask for beat marker, node ID, logical leader, physical relay,
  role, and radio/position quality indicators;
- diagnostic verbosity;
- optional automatic expiry.

Only the enabled bit maps to v2 `Options.debugging`; the remaining indicators are
v3-only. Debug authority uses the ordinary claim/session/lease machinery so a stale
debug controller cannot leave an installation permanently covered by diagnostics.
Entering compatibility mode disables v3-only indicators and uses the bridged v2
debugging bit on every upgraded device.

### Control topic

Control carries the existing `Options`, `Action`, and `Info` commands without
forcing an all-v3 component to emit legacy packets. Its body begins with the v2
command ID and a one-byte command length, followed by at most 46 command bytes.
Receivers accept only those three known commands with their existing validated body
shapes. Upgrade offers remain v2-compatibility-only because their current platform
shape is not a stable bounded payload.

### Position frame authority and distributed estimates

"Position master" means coordinate-frame authority, not a central position solver.
It establishes the frame namespace, epoch, origin, axis, and positive-Y convention.
Each device still estimates only its own position from direct radio neighbors using
bounded local state, as specified in
[`../simulator/POSITIONING_PROTOCOL_DESIGN.md`](../simulator/POSITIONING_PROTOCOL_DESIGN.md).

Position has two message classes:

- Frame `Claim`, `State`, and `Release` use root arbitration when an operator or
  configured anchor establishes a frame authority.
- Position advertisements use `Neighbors`, remain one-hop, and associate RSSI only with
  the physical transport sender. A device propagates a frame by advertising its own
  resulting belief, never by relaying somebody else's position packet verbatim.

Without an explicit position authority, configured anchors or deterministic floating
origin/axis/orientation election provide the frame exactly as in the positioning
design. Frame authority and lighting topics remain independent.

Positioning is suspended in compatibility mode because v2 has no position contract.
An upgraded device may retain its last estimate internally, but it marks the estimate
stale and neither broadcasts nor uses it for new visible behavior. Resuming v3 starts
a new position authority session or revalidates the configured anchored frame before
the estimate becomes usable again.

The candidate implements frame authority, an eight-entry direct-peer table with a
five-second freshness timeout, and compatibility suspension. The RSSI estimator and
multilateration solver described
in the positioning design remain a separate rendering/estimation integration step.

### Scheduled visual look-ahead

Pattern, palette, and scheduled effect messages preserve the v2 current/next model.
Each authority maintains bounded current and next entries. Heartbeats reference both,
and definitions needed by the next entry are repeated before activation.

Beat is intentionally current-only because live musical timing is not normally known
in advance. Debug is state plus lease. Position carries frame freshness and current
belief rather than a visual schedule.

### Legacy detection and compatibility trailer

The compatibility policy needs to distinguish a genuine v2-only sender from a v3
device temporarily speaking v2. Without such a distinction, upgraded poles would
continually detect one another as legacy and compatibility mode could never expire.

Every v3-capable device therefore places a 16-byte `VNextCompatibilityTrailer` in
payload bytes `48..63` of every v2 packet it originates while speaking v2. Those bytes
are unused by the stable v2 `State` payload and by all other stable v2 commands. V2
receivers already ignore them. Upgrade traffic whose payload is not safely bounded
below offset 48 is excluded from this trailer scheme and is not emitted by the normal
compatibility bridge.

| Trailer offset | Size | Field | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 2 | `magic` | Little-endian `0x4E58`. |
| 2 | 1 | `trailerVersion` | Starts at `1`. |
| 3 | 1 | `flags` | Next-capable, compatibility-active, legacy-evidence, or resume-proposed. |
| 4 | 2 | `controlId` | Evidence witness while legacy is active; resume coordinator afterward. |
| 6 | 2 | `controlSession` | Random witness/coordinator boot nonce. |
| 8 | 2 | `generation` | Advancing evidence heartbeat or resume proposal generation. |
| 10 | 2 | `resumePhrase` | Coordinated v3 resume phrase, or zero. |
| 12 | 1 | `hopCount` | Incremented when evidence or a proposal is propagated. |
| 13 | 1 | `reserved` | Send zero; ignore after the trailer validates. |
| 14 | 2 | `crc16` | Integrity check over trailer bytes `0..13`; this validates the marker but does not authenticate it. |

A valid trailer is an additive marker, not a new interpretation of any v2 field.
Both magic bytes, the trailer version, reserved byte, and CRC must validate before a
packet is classified as vNext-generated. The selected magic and flag allocation
must still be checked against captured fleet traffic before rollout. A failed marker
check is conservatively treated as genuine legacy evidence.

Legacy evidence is interpreted as follows:

- Any structurally valid v2 packet without a valid compatibility trailer proves
  genuine legacy presence. This remains true if an old relay changed the outer
  sender header, because it preserves the unmarked payload.
- A v3-capable direct observer becomes an evidence witness. While it continues to
  hear unmarked v2 traffic, it advances its witness generation and sets
  `legacy-evidence` in its own marked v2 heartbeats.
- Other upgraded devices adopt and propagate fresh marked evidence, incrementing
  `hopCount`. They do not pretend to have directly heard the old pole.
- Marked compatibility traffic without fresh legacy evidence never renews the
  evidence lease. It therefore cannot make fallback permanent by itself.
- Multiple witnesses may exist. Devices retain the best fresh witness tuple using
  bounded state and may replace an expired witness with another one they continue to
  hear.

### Compatibility state machine

Every upgraded node runs the following component-local state machine:

| State | Sends | Applies | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Next` | V3 topics only. | Independent v3 authorities. | Fresh unmarked v2 or propagated legacy evidence. |
| `CompatibilityPending` | Marked v2 bridge traffic; no new v3 application packets. | Current output while scheduling v2 fallbacks. | All visual topics have crossed their safe fallback boundary. |
| `Compatibility` | Marked v2 traffic only. | Complete v2 state and commands. | Legacy evidence lease expires and a resume proposal is adopted. |
| `ResumePending` | Marked v2 traffic only. | V2 state initialized for seamless v3 bootstrap. | Coordinated `resumePhrase`, unless new evidence cancels it. |

On compatibility entry:

1. Stop accepting new v3 claims and stop emitting v3 application topics
   immediately.
2. Cancel unapplied v3-only future entries.
3. Build a complete v2 `current + next` snapshot from the active topic states.
4. Keep the current pixels stable, then switch pattern, palette, and persistent
   effect to their explicit v2 fallbacks at their next declared boundaries.
5. Bridge Beat through v2 state immediately and through one phrase-boundary `Beats`
   declaration when BPM changed.
6. Map Debug to `Options.debugging` and suspend Position traffic.
7. Begin normal tested v2 heartbeat and relay behavior, adding only the ignored
   compatibility trailer.

The initial evidence lease should be 30 seconds and must be validated against the
slowest real v2 follower cadence and multi-hop relaying. Fresh evidence restarts the
lease. Packet loss alone should not make a component oscillate between protocols.

### Coordinated return to v3

When no legacy witness heartbeat has advanced for the evidence lease:

1. Each upgraded device may propose itself after evidence expires; proposals
   converge on the highest active `controlId`, so a previously heard node that has
   left the component cannot block recovery forever.
2. The winning coordinator carries a new generation and a `resumePhrase` at least
   one full phrase in the future.
3. Nodes repeat the proposal in their compatibility trailers while continuing v2.
4. Fresh legacy evidence cancels the proposal immediately.
5. At `resumePhrase`, nodes initialize every v3 topic from the current v2 snapshot,
   stop routine v2 transmission, and start v3 Presence and topic heartbeats. This
   protocol switch causes no immediate visible change.
6. V3-only literal colors, generated patterns, debug overlays, and position state do
   not silently revive. Their authorities must issue fresh claims or states in new
   sessions after the resume boundary.

Nodes that miss the proposal remain on v2. Their marked v2 packets do not count as
legacy evidence, and a later repeated proposal can bring them forward. If an actual
legacy pole remains but was temporarily unheard, its next unmarked packet immediately
returns the component to compatibility mode.

### V2 bridge ownership

While compatibility is active, v3 topic authorities no longer compete on the wire.
The component runs the existing v2 leadership and complete `State` behavior. The
compatibility bridge is a projection of the last accepted v3 topic states into one
v2 snapshot, followed by ordinary v2 changes.

| V3 topic | V2 projection |
|---|---|
| Beat | `bpm`, `beatFrame`, and phrase-boundary `Beats`. |
| Pattern | `patternId`, `syncMode`, current/next pattern phrases. |
| Palette | Required `legacyPaletteId`, current/next palette phrases. |
| Effect | Existing effect/pen/pulse/chance fields or `None`. |
| Debug | `Options.debugging`; v3-only overlay bits are disabled. |
| Position | No projection; suspend and mark stale. |

Once fallback completes, upgraded poles deliberately show the same representable
state as legacy poles. They must not keep a richer v3 palette or effect merely because
they are capable of doing so.

### Forward compatibility

V3 topic evolution follows these rules:

| Mechanism | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Per-topic versions | A receiver may support Beat v1 while ignoring Palette v2. |
| Stable field numbers | A field number keeps one meaning forever. |
| Typed/skippable fields | Unknown tagged fields can be skipped safely. |
| Optional by default | Absent fields use documented defaults. |
| Additive changes | New behavior uses new fields or topic versions. |
| Retired fields reserved | Removed field and enum numbers are never reused. |
| Reserved flags | Unknown optional flags are ignored; required behavior needs a capability bit. |
| Stable fallbacks | Rich visual values carry v2-compatible fallbacks. |
| Unknown topics | Ignore without changing output, authority, or compatibility state. |

### Traffic budget

V3 removes routine v2 traffic in an all-v3 component, but positioning adds a
per-device stream. Initial maximum cadences are:

| Traffic | Maximum initial cadence |
|---|---:|
| Presence | 0.1 packet/second/device. |
| Beat authority | 2 packets/second total at 120 BPM, with a configurable ceiling. |
| Pattern authority | Event burst plus 0.1 packet/second heartbeat. |
| Palette authority | Definition/schedule burst plus 0.1 packet/second heartbeat. |
| Effect authority | Event burst plus 0.1 packet/second heartbeat. |
| Debug authority | On change plus 0.1 packet/second heartbeat while claimed. |
| Position | 1 packet/second/enabled device before adaptive backoff. |

Every periodic sender derives a stable phase from node ID and boot/session state and
adds bounded jitter, preventing lockstep bursts. A device sends no second ESP-NOW
packet until the previous send callback completes. The receive path records per-topic
accepted, rejected, duplicate, stale, and queue-drop counters. Fleet-scale tests must
exercise the current six-message receive queue before enabling the one-second position
cadence by default.

### Security and validation

V3 inherits the existing LAN/event-local trust model and does not add encryption by
default. It nevertheless expands the consequences of a spoofed packet, especially
for debug control, beat authority, literal palettes, and position anchors.

At first ingress, firmware must validate packet length, outer version, recipient
class, topic ID, topic version, body length, message kind, flags, IDs, lease, sequence,
field lengths, counts, coordinates, phrase/timestamp age, and every enum/range before
copying or applying data. Invalid packets fail closed and do not refresh topology,
authority, compatibility evidence, or leases. Literal palette parsing writes only to
a fixed temporary value and commits atomically after the complete body validates.

Authentication of topic claims and surveyed position anchors is a possible future
capability. It is not silently implied by `authorityId`, priority, a device MAC, or
the compatibility trailer.

### Required test matrix

The design is ready for firmware work only when the harness can express these
outcomes:

1. All-v3 pattern, palette, beat, debug, and position authorities reside on five
   different devices and remain independent through relays.
2. A literal palette definition is received before activation, activates on its
   phrase, heals a late joiner, and never displays partially.
3. Missing palette definitions leave the previous palette active.
4. A v2 pole introduced next to one v3 leaf causes compatibility evidence to cross a
   multi-hop component and stops v3 application traffic everywhere reachable.
5. V3-generated marked v2 traffic never counts as genuine legacy evidence.
6. Upgraded and legacy poles converge on the same pattern, fallback palette, beat,
   effect, brightness, and debug state in compatibility mode.
7. A v2 pole disappearing lets evidence expire, produces one coordinated resume
   proposal, and resumes v3 at the announced phrase without a visible jump.
8. A legacy packet received during `ResumePending` cancels resume immediately.
9. A real legacy pole missed during recovery forces fallback again on its next
   packet without reviving old v3 authority sessions.
10. A disconnected component resumes independently and falls back when it later
    merges with a component containing legacy evidence.
11. Duplicate, reordered, stale-session, oversized, malformed, and unknown-topic
    packets do not alter state or renew leases.
12. Authority release, lease expiry, device reboot, transport-root change, partition,
    and merge have explicit results for every topic.
13. Sixty-four simulated devices at maximum initial cadences do not produce
    synchronized bursts, unbounded relay loops, or silent queue loss.
14. V2-only firmware continues to follow the resulting v2 bridge without any code
    change.

### Compatibility failure analysis

The feared event is a mixed connected component showing divergent output because
some devices run v3 while a legacy device can understand only v2. The compatibility
state machine fails toward v2 because a false fallback costs features temporarily,
while a missed fallback breaks the installation's visible contract.

| Failure mode | Effect | Mitigation | Residual expectation |
|---|---|---|---|
| A legacy packet is lost. | Fallback is delayed. | Legacy senders repeat normal v2 state, and witnesses hold evidence for a 30-second lease. | Credible on one packet; unlikely to persist while the legacy sender remains active and reachable. |
| A vNext trailer is corrupted or only partly recognized. | An upgraded sender is mistaken for legacy. | Require magic, version, reserved byte, and CRC to validate, then fail conservatively into compatibility. | Temporary feature loss; no visual split once fallback completes. |
| Old firmware previously wrote nonzero unused bytes that resemble the marker. | A real legacy sender could be mistaken for vNext. | Capture representative fleet traffic, choose a non-colliding magic, and require the complete CRC-checked trailer. | Low after fleet capture; this is the most important pre-deployment compatibility check. |
| A witness disappears while another legacy pole remains. | Evidence can expire and v3 can resume too early. | Any other direct observer becomes a witness; the still-present legacy pole forces fallback again on its next unmarked packet. | A temporary protocol transition is possible in a lossy or partitioned component. |
| Nodes miss the coordinated resume proposal. | Some upgraded nodes remain in marked-v2 mode while others resume v3. | Marked v2 is not legacy evidence; repeat the resume proposal and initialize v3 from the same v2 snapshot. | Temporary transport split without an immediate visual jump. |
| A literal palette has no exact v2 equivalent. | Compatibility output differs from the richer all-v3 output. | Require the color master to choose `legacyPaletteId` before scheduling the literal palette, then switch everyone at a palette boundary. | Intentional color approximation, shared by old and new devices. |
| The radio mesh partitions. | No component can know about legacy poles across the partition. | Define evidence and fallback per connected component; re-enter compatibility immediately when components merge and unmarked v2 is observed. | Global unanimity is impossible without connectivity; the protocol guarantees component-local convergence. |
| A spoofed packet claims legacy evidence or topic authority. | Features can be disabled or visual state controlled. | Strict validation prevents malformed state, but the current unauthenticated trust model cannot prove sender identity. | Credible on an untrusted nearby radio; authentication is required if this threat enters scope. |

### Staged implementation

1. **Dual decoder and observability:** accept v2 and v3, add packet counters and
   Presence, but keep v3 application topics disabled.
2. **Compatibility detector:** add the ignored v2 trailer, witness propagation,
   fallback state machine, and coordinated phrase-boundary resume. Prove it with
   unchanged v2 firmware before adding richer features.
3. **Independent existing topics:** split Beat, Pattern, Effect, and Debug authority
   while projecting them back into v2.
4. **Literal Palette:** add fixed definition caches, phrase-keyed activation, and
   required legacy palette fallback.
5. **Position frame:** integrate the existing positioning design with Position
   suspended during compatibility.
6. **Fleet evaluation:** simulate and hardware-test partitions, old relays, packet
   loss, queue pressure, and repeated protocol transitions before enabling v3 by
   default.

This candidate implements stages 1 through 4 and the Position frame/advertisement
portion of stage 5. Host tests cover body validation, independent authority leases,
legacy-marker behavior, phrase-boundary resume, stale-sequence rejection, relay
version preservation, and atomic gradient expansion. Stage 6, real v2 capture
validation, queue-pressure testing, and the position estimator are still required
before fleet rollout.

The current operator surface includes the existing WLED JSON-state request. `palette16`
accepts exactly 16 integer `0xRRGGBB` values and samples them into eight transmitted
gradient stops, with optional `legacyPalette`, `palettePhrase`, and
`paletteTransition`. Without `legacyPalette`, the sender chooses the nearest fixed
fallback. `positionFrame` establishes a namespace,
epoch, and anchor IDs; `position` supplies validated Q8.8 coordinates and quality;
`debugMask` and `debugVerbosity` update the independent Debug topic. These are
runtime controls and do not persist literal palettes to flash.

## Implementation Encoding Notes

The WLED implementation currently sends native C++ objects directly:

- `NodeMessage` is under `#pragma pack(push,4)`.
- `MessageRecipients` is a default enum, so it is 4 bytes.
- `MeshNodeHeader` is 6 bytes because of tail padding.
- `NodeMessage` is 84 bytes.
- `TubeState` is 24 bytes.
- `TubeStates` is 48 bytes.

The implementation initializes the 64-byte `data` array to zero before copying the
command payload into it. Padding bytes should not be interpreted.

## Current Implementation Hazards

These are not ideal protocol properties, but they are true of the deployed WLED
implementation and must be considered during refactors.

### Version Filtering

The candidate receiver accepts only exact 84-byte packets whose outer version is
`2` or `3`, then dispatches the payload to separate validated decoders. Relays
preserve the received outer version, so an upgraded relay cannot accidentally turn a
v2 packet into v3 or vice versa.

### State Payload Adjacency

The intended `State` payload is `current VisualState` followed by `next
VisualState`. The current sender implementation broadcasts 48 bytes starting at the
`current_state` member and relies on `current_state` and `next_state` being adjacent
members in `PatternController`.

Refactors must preserve the payload layout even if the implementation stops relying
on member adjacency.

### Info Broadcast

The candidate fixes the prior pointer-address bug in `broadcast_info(NodeInfo*)` and
sends the bounded `NodeInfo` payload. Existing v2 layout and routing are unchanged.

### Upgrade Payload Size

The `Upgrade` command refers to `AutoUpdateOffer`, but that struct may exceed the
64-byte command payload depending on platform ABI. The current update path is not a
stable mesh protocol surface.

### Palette IDs

Current Tubes builds modify WLED's fixed palette registry to include Tubes palettes.
Future implementations may move those palettes into WLED custom/usermod/runtime
slots, but the mesh `paletteId` must remain Tubes palette intent, not WLED runtime
slot identity.

## WLED Rendering Mapping

The current WLED implementation maps protocol pattern IDs to either internal
virtual-strip patterns or WLED FX modes.

| Pattern IDs | Rendering strategy |
|---|---|
| 0..23 | Tubes virtual-strip functions. |
| 24..64 | WLED FX selected through `gPatterns`. |

The implementation currently composites via `handleOverlayDraw()` and
`VirtualStrip`. Future WLED versions may render the same protocol state through
native WLED segments, layers, or FX, as long as the visible meaning of v2 state is
preserved.

## WLED Serial Commands That Emit Mesh Messages

The serial console is not part of the mesh protocol, but it is a common operator
surface for producing mesh traffic.

Routine packet and status tracing is quiet until the device receives a serial
character. Any command, including an empty newline, enables tracing for 60
seconds; further input renews the lease. Startup messages and errors remain
unconditional. Quiet devices print one dot per second and add
`[press enter]` every 50 dots as a low-cost liveness signal. This avoids
blocking LED rendering on an unattended device while letting a serial watcher
activate field diagnostics as soon as it connects.

| Serial command | Mesh effect |
|---|---|
| `b###` | Request/set BPM. Followers send `Beats`; roots update and broadcast `State`. |
| `s` | Start phrase and broadcast `State`. |
| `n` | Move the earliest scheduled change to the next phrase boundary and broadcast state. |
| `p###` | Schedule the pattern ID for the next phrase boundary. |
| `pW,<fx>,<speed>,<intensity>,<c1>,<c2>,<c3>,<mask>,<values>,<sync>,<fallback>,<hold>` | Make the connected pole Pattern Master and schedule an exact WLED program. A zero hold pauses automatic pattern rotation. |
| `pT,<pattern>,<sync>,<fallback>,<hold>` | Make the connected pole Pattern Master and schedule an exact Tubes renderer program. |
| `m###` | Schedule the sync mode for the next phrase boundary. |
| `c###` or `c<id>,<hold>` | Schedule the palette ID for the next phrase boundary, optionally pausing with a zero hold. |
| `g` | Make the connected pole Palette Master and immediately publish its current/next gradients. |
| `g0:RRGGBB,...,255:RRGGBB` | Make the connected pole Palette Master and schedule a custom two-to-eight-stop gradient at the next phrase; the nearest fixed legacy fallback is selected automatically. |
| `gH,<hold>,0:RRGGBB,...,255:RRGGBB` | Schedule the same custom gradient with an explicit phrase hold; zero pauses rotation. |
| `e###` | Schedule the next effect from the WLED `gEffects` table at the next phrase boundary. |
| `%###` | Schedule the effect chance at the next phrase boundary. |
| `D0`, `D1` | Broadcast a selected-scope `Action` that explicitly disables or enables debugging. Generation-0 poles ignore the unknown `D` key. |
| `f###`, `F###` | Flash the connected pole or selected poles with the requested palette/color value. New firmware transports selected `F` as additive action key `H`; generation-0 poles ignore `H`, while incoming legacy `F` retains its original flash-everyone meaning. |
| `U`, `V`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `@`, `G`, `A`, `W`, `X`, `R`, `M` | Broadcast `Action`. |
| `z` | Request a nonce-bound report from every visible gen1 device. Reports include stable MAC, Device ID and uplink, firmware release/hash, hardware family/variant, role, mesh state, uptime, LED count, bus count, first pin, and first bus type. |
| `z############` | Request the same report from one stable 12-digit MAC. |
| `y####` | Route an update-selection request to one four-digit hexadecimal Device ID. The matching device reports its stable MAC, then starts `WLED-UPDATE` without physical selection. |
| `Y<release>,<IPv4>,<port>,<window>,<target>,<nonce>,<SSID>,<password>` | Emit one gen1 parallel-pull offer. `target=0000` addresses every compatible pole; normal operation uses `fleet_pull_update.py` so secrets are not printed. |
| `P<offer>` | Send an exact-target `Fleet Update Propagate` command. The chosen current Dig2Go immediately serves its running image; this never enters `WLED-UPDATE` selection or requires a button. |
| `O`, `O0`, `O1` | Locally ask the connected Beat owner to schedule toggle, disable, or rotating sound-overlay behavior. The resulting Beat state is the only wire message. |
| `J1`, `J0` | Enter or leave the audio workshop. Entry holds a black base and makes the connected pole Beat Master; exit restores normal scheduled pattern, palette, and overlay behavior. |
| `J>`, `J<` | Browse the workshop overlay candidates without reflashing. |
| `J+`, `J-` | Record a RAM-only positive or negative vote for the current overlay, then advance. `J?` prints the current candidate. |
| `j0`, `j1` | Disable or enable local microphone tempo tracking. Only the current Beat owner applies estimates; this command emits no new wire action. |
| `P` | Toggle power saving, then broadcast the legacy-compatible explicit `@0` or `@1` action. |

`d0` and `d1` explicitly disable or enable debugging only on the USB-connected pole.
The legacy lowercase `d` wire action remains accepted with its existing explicit
boolean argument, but new serial input never emits it. Other local-only commands
include sound-overlay selection, local reboot, local role set, local AP control, and
local ID reset.
The JSON operation surface uses the same local `d` and selected `F` defaults as
serial unless its explicit `to` field overrides the scope.

Generation-0 `Options` combines brightness and debugging in one payload, so legacy
brightness broadcasts still carry both fields as required by the deployed layout.
Generation-1 receivers apply only the brightness portion of that compatibility
payload and retain their independently targeted Debug state.

Automatic tempo tracking is off after every boot. When enabled, it changes the
ordinary Beat state produced by the local Beat owner, so receivers of every
generation continue to consume their existing BPM and beat-frame representation.
See [`TEMPO_TRACKING.md`](TEMPO_TRACKING.md) for the estimator and its test boundary.

The bare `z` request uses the all-zero MAC as its explicit wildcard. Responders
derive a bounded delay from their Device ID so a neighborhood does not answer in one
synchronized ESP-NOW burst. Tooling correlates the nonce and deduplicates by stable
MAC; it repeats the request and merges replies because broadcast delivery is not
guaranteed. Device IDs are intentionally reboot-scoped, so an operator must take `y####`
from a fresh manifest; the updater still locks every HTTP write and post-reboot
verification to the stable MAC reported by the selected device.
